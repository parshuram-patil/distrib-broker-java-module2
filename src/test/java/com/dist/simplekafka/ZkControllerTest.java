     * Tests the distributed controller election process with multiple brokers.
     * This test verifies that:
     * 1. When multiple brokers attempt to become controller simultaneously,
     *    only one succeeds (demonstrating ZooKeeper's atomic operations)
     * 2. All brokers agree on who the controller is (demonstrating consensus)
     * 3. The lowest broker ID (1) becomes the controller (implementation detail
     *    of how the election works in this example)
     * 
     * Real-world implications:
     * - In a distributed system, we must ensure only one controller exists
     * - All nodes must have the same view of who the controller is
     * - This test shows how ZooKeeper prevents "split-brain" scenarios where
     *   multiple nodes think they're the controller
